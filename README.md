### Introduction
Modern forensics refers to the use of advanced scientific, technological, and digital techniques in the investigation and resolution of criminal cases. Unlike traditional forensics, it encompasses not only biology and chemistry but also computer science, data analytics, and artificial intelligence.

### Forensic Objectives
 * Evidence collection and preservation
 * Identification of perpetrators
 * Understanding the timeline and nature of criminal events
 * Providing solid, scientific proof in courts of law
 * Preventing future crimes through proactive analysis

### Why We Need Forensics
 * Criminals are using more sophisticated tools (e.g., encrypted messaging, deepfakes)
 * Forensics enables accurate identification and exoneration of the innocent
 * It supports digital evidence, which is now critical in most crimes
 * It strengthens the credibility of judicial systems
 * It aids in national security and cybersecurity

### Cybercrime
 Cybercrime refers to criminal activities carried out through computers, networks, or the internet. It is one of the fastest-growing forms of crime globally and can cause massive financial, psychological, and societal harm.

Cybercrime examples:
> Stealing personal data (identity theft)
> Attacking systems (DDoS, ransomware)
> Online fraud (phishing, scams)
> Exploiting digital platforms (social media abuse, darknet markets)

### Types of Cybercrime

* Hacking – Unauthorized access to systems
* Phishing – Deceiving users to reveal sensitive information
* Ransomware – Encrypting files and demanding payment
* Identity Theft – Using someone else’s identity for fraud
* Cyberstalking – Harassment through digital means
* Online Fraud – Financial scams using e-commerce or banking platforms

Child Exploitation – Sharing illegal or abusive content

Data Breach – Theft or exposure of personal/confidential information
